# Privacy Policy for Checker

**Last updated: January 11, 2026**

Miksik Labs ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Checker mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data Stored Locally

Checker is designed with your privacy in mind. **All data is stored locally on your device**. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on external servers.

The following data is stored exclusively on your device:

- **Work Hours Data**: Hours worked, start/end times, break durations, and notes you enter for each day
- **Company Information**: Company names you create and associated hourly rates
- **App Preferences**: Your selected settings and preferences

### No Data Collection

We want to be clear: **Checker does not collect any personal data**. We do not:

- Collect or store your work hours data on our servers
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other personal information
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Share any information with third parties
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies

## Device Security Features

Checker supports Face ID and Touch ID authentication to protect your data. This biometric data is:

- Processed entirely by your device's secure enclave
- Never accessed, stored, or transmitted by our app
- Managed by Apple's built-in security framework

## Data Storage and Security

All your data is stored in your device's local storage using industry-standard practices:

- Data remains on your device and is not synced to any cloud service
- Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features
- Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all stored data

## Export Feature

The PDF export feature generates reports that are saved to your device or shared through iOS's share functionality. These exports are created locally and we have no access to exported files.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information:
